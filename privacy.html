                It's pretty simple. The website and app don't save any information about you, other than what you explicitly put into it. No location data, no contacts data, nothing like that. It only stores the categories and transactions you enter. You can't see other people's data, and they can't see yours. If you want to remove a transaction or a category, delete it through the app or the site. I don't back it up. Poof doesn't exist.
